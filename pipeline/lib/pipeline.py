           The pipeline performst the following steps:
           1. extracting the images from the microscopy formats (eg czi) to tiff format
           2. Prepare thumbnails of images for quality control
           3. clean the images
           4. align the images
           5. convert to Seung lab neuroglancer cloudvolume format

           step 3 and 4 are first performed on downsampled images, and the image masks(for step 3) and the within stack alignments(for step 4) are
           upsampled for use in the full resolution images
